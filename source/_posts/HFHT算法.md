# 论文关键点


### abstract

- combine latent rating dimensions with latent review topics.
- In spite of the wealth of research on modeling ratings, the other form of feedback present on review websites—namely, the reviews themselves—is typically ignored. In our opinion, ignoring this rich source of information is a major shortcoming of existing work on recommender systems 


# 论文的问题
- item的rating和review,两个比起来,对于新用户来说,更愿意rating,因为review是比rating操作更为复杂的步骤
